My research interest lies in exploring the **unique intelligence that emerges from collective/social behaviors** such as cooperation, adaptation, imitation, teaching, confrontation and so on. I am particularly focused on **applying machine learning techniques—especially reinforcement learning—to study such multi-agent systems**. This also involves leveraging tools from game theory, theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning, agent modeling, and analytical models derived from social sciences.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at [University of Washington, CSE](https://www.cs.washington.edu/),  co-advised by [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com) and [Natasha Jaques](https://natashajaques.ai). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Tsinghua University, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), guided by [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).
